# lizcheneyd

Very important system daemon that downloads images of Liz Cheney
off the internet.

## System requirements
lizcheneyd does not support Windows, and has very limited support
for macOS. lizcheneyd works best on a Linux system, and requires
permission to create files in `/var/lib/lizcheneyd`.

lizcheneyd requires an Internet connection to download images of
Liz Cheney.
